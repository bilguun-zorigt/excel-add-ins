# Excel Add-ins

A collection of Excel add-ins developed between 2014-2016.

This was an old project of mine when I was still learning how to code, so the structure may not be the best. However, these add-ins still come in handy from time to time and work great. I'm sharing this on GitHub as a public archive in case it helps others.
